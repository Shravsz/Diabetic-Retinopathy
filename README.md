 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
📘 Overview
This project aims to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images using Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and reduce the risk of vision loss through automated image analysis.

🚀 Features
Automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy stages

Image preprocessing for noise removal and normalization

CNN-based deep learning model (e.g., ResNet / VGG / Custom CNN)

Visualization of model accuracy and loss

Streamlit / Flask web app for easy image upload and prediction (if included)

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook

Streamlit / Flask (optional)
